The Center’s founder and first imam, Vehbi Ismail, came to Detroit in 1949 and established the Albanian American Moslem Society in the same year. The congregation met first at the International Institute of Detroit, moved to a former Armenian church on Hamilton Avenue, and shared prayer space briefly with the American Moslem Society in Dearborn while waiting for their current structure to be completed. Imam Shuajb Gerguri became acting head of the mosque in 1996 upon Imam Ismail’s retirement.","The Albanian Islamic Center, built in Harper Woods in 1963, boasts a distinctive Balkan-style dome and minaret. With a prayer area, offices, large social hall, classrooms, and kitchen, the mosque serves an old Albanian American community (already well established in the 1940s) and new Muslim immigrants from Albania, Kosovo, Macedonia, and other Balkan countries. The center provides weekend religious instruction in Arabic, Albanian, and English along with other educational and service programs. The Albanian Islamic Center is open to Muslims from all ethnic backgrounds, but immigrants from Europe and their descendents form its core membership and predominate on its board. The mosque is unusual for its location in Detroit’s eastern suburbs.",https://www.flickr.com/photos/biid/2639660403/in/album-72157605999298753/,,,,www.flickr.com/photos/biid/2639660673/in/album-72157605999298753/

The first Bangladeshi mosque in Hamtramck, Al-Islah was originally located in a small storefront on Joseph Campau and moved to its current home, a renovated medical clinic, in 2001. Al-Islah Islamic Center gained national media attention in 2004, when the congregation sought to broadcast their idhan (call to prayer) from a loudspeaker outside the mosque. The idhan has been broadcast publicly in Detroit since the 1970s, and in Dearborn since the 1980s, but many Hamtramck residents opposed this practice in their city. Al-Islah’s leadership found itself embroiled in an election year battle with the City Council. The matter was resolved in a special city-wide referendum, which Al-Islah and their supporters won handily. The mosque recently purchased a large historic building at the corner of Caniff and Joseph Campau which they plan to develop into a mosque and community center. The renovated larger space is expected to open in 2016. ","The Al-Islah Islamic Center is open daily for all prayers. The masjid occupies two floors of a building that was previously a medical clinic. It has a separate prayer space for women. The interior decoration is minimal, consisting mostly of a row of arches in the main prayer hall. Al-Islah currently sponsors a weekend Islamic school for children, where Arabic, Bangla, and Qur’an are taught. The congregation also runs a summer school. Adults meet weekly for tafsir (Qur’an study) on Sundays, and youth meetings are held once a month. Women attend the center most frequently for tafsir and special programming. While the mosque was founded by Bangladeshis, it is open to all Muslims. The administration has good relations with the local school board, with other mosques in the area, and with local churches and interfaith coalitions.",,,,,

Unlike their neighbor in Warren, IONA, this community experienced no difficulties with zoning boards or city administrators.

In the 1940's and 50's the building was used for occasional lectures and other education activities, such as Arabic and Quranic classes.  It is unclear when the group took the name Moslem Mosque of Highland Park, but this name was photographed in 1956 by the Detroit Free Press. The group incorporated in March 1958, as a ""Moslem church"" with a charter from Islamic Center, Washington D.C.. The incorporation provisions make several points, 1. That the group is to be non-sectarian, 2. That it hopes to buy, rent, or build a ""mosque"".  Nonetheless, the group's membership was Shi'a and was closely connected to the Progressive Arabian Hashemite Society in Dearborn.  Incorporating members included Mike Hamzey, Allia Agemy, Hussein Alli Hamood, Mustafa Salem, Mustafa Hayime, Abdul Beryy, Charles Allie, and Mohammed Berry.  All but Mr. Berry lived in Highland Park.  Berry lived on Electric Street in Detroit.  In 1963, Hussein Hamood became the registered agent, and in 1964, Kamal Nasser became the agent.  Shortly after this, the group folded their books into those of the Islamic Center of America (Detroit) in exchange for a position or two on the ICD's board of directors.  The building was sold and the proceeds given to the ICD.",,,,,,
