The center provides weekend religious instruction in Arabic, Albanian, and English along with other educational and service programs. The Albanian Islamic Center is open to Muslims from all ethnic backgrounds, but immigrants from Europe and their descendents form its core membership and predominate on its board. The mosque is unusual for its location in Detroit’s eastern suburbs.","Among the oldest mosques in metro Detroit, the Albanian Islamic Center was opened in 1963. The Center’s founder and first imam, Vehbi Ismail, came to Detroit in 1949 and established the Albanian American Moslem Society in the same year. The congregation met first at the International Institute of Detroit, moved to a former Armenian church on Hamilton Avenue, and shared prayer space briefly with the American Moslem Society in Dearborn while waiting for their current structure to be completed.

Adults meet weekly for tafsir (Qur’an study) on Sundays, and youth meetings are held once a month. Women attend the center most frequently for tafsir and special programming.

The first Bangladeshi mosque in Hamtramck, Al-Islah was originally located in a small storefront on Joseph Campau and moved to its current home, a renovated medical clinic, in 2001. Al-Islah Islamic Center gained national media attention in 2004, when the congregation sought to broadcast their idhan (call to prayer) from a loudspeaker outside the mosque. The idhan has been broadcast publicly in Detroit since the 1970s, and in Dearborn since the 1980s, but many Hamtramck residents opposed this practice in their city. Al-Islah’s leadership found itself embroiled in an election year battle with the City Council. The matter was resolved in a special city-wide referendum, which Al-Islah and their supporters won handily. The mosque recently purchased a large historic building at the corner of Caniff and Joseph Campau which they plan to develop into a mosque and community center.

The goal was to establish a mosque in the city of Dearborn Heights, MI that would operate upon the noble Islamic principles of Ahlus-Sunnah wal Jama’ah. The Board of Trustees searched diligently for an adequate building for this mosque, and lack of sufficient funds called for an adjustment of plans. In November 2009, members of the community decided to rent a space in a shopping plaza in Garden City. For the next five year, this space would serve as a musallah for the community. In June 2014, the Board of Trustees felt a strong need for establishing a full-fledged mosque, and so they began the search for an appropriate building and location. They identified a very suitable and appropriate sized building in the city of Westland. During Ramadan of that year, a fundraising Iftar was organized. All praise is due to Allah, the fundraising was successful and the building was purchased under a land contract. After a couple of months of renovation, the new mosque opened its doors on December 1, 2014. The building costs have since been paid off, and several new renovations have been completed. Among them was a complete rebuilding of the bathrooms for men and women, external brick lining of the building, brand new HVAC units, new high efficiency windows, and a 100% coverage security camera system.

It is unclear when the group took the name Moslem Mosque of Highland Park, but this name was photographed in 1956 by the Detroit Free Press. The group incorporated in March 1958, as a ""Moslem church"" with a charter from Islamic Center, Washington D.C.. The incorporation provisions make several points, 1. That the group is to be non-sectarian, 2. That it hopes to buy, rent, or build a ""mosque"".  Nonetheless, the group's membership was Shi'a and was closely connected to the Progressive Arabian Hashemite Society in Dearborn.  Incorporating members included Mike Hamzey, Allia Agemy, Hussein Alli Hamood, Mustafa Salem, Mustafa Hayime, Abdul Beryy, Charles Allie, and Mohammed Berry.  All but Mr. Berry lived in Highland Park.  Berry lived on Electric Street in Detroit.  In 1963, Hussein Hamood became the registered agent, and in 1964, Kamal Nasser became the agent.  Shortly after this, the group folded their books into those of the Islamic Center of America (Detroit) in exchange for a position or two on the ICD's board of directors.
