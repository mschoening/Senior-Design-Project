	<h1>About this program: </h1>
	
	

<div id = "About"> <!-- Start div for about -->
		<p>This program was created for a Senior Design Project by Team Halal Metropolis
			 the intent for users to be able to interact with the Map to show Mosques through a period of time
			 In addition there are many features to the program such as:
			 Time Slider - Allows you to pick a time frame to see what Mosques existed when and if they are closed
			 Filter - Find out the main denomination of people that primarily make up the Mosque
			 Search - Find a specific Mosque getting additional information about the mosque, opening date, closing date, branches
			 <!-- Initial pop up screen with a short message, can add Halal Metropolis image here -->
	</p>

	<h2><b>Time Slider Tab</b></h2>
		<p>The Time Slider tab allows you to change how the map looks using the following :<br>
			1) The Time Slider<br>
			2) Map Highlight Mode<br>
			3) Toggle Connection Layer<br>
		</p>

	<h3>Time Slider:</h3>
		<p>Using the Time Slider will allow you to pick a specific time frame based on year.
			 To use the time slider simply scroll up and down using your finger.
			 As you scroll notice the year displayed on the bottom.
			 Based on the year, mosques will start appearing on the map as pillars indicating their starting date
			 As you scroll the pillars will grow in size which indicate how long they have existed.
			 If a mosque changes colour, this indicates the mosque is closed.
			 Additionally, while you scroll through time, connections between pillars will appear creating a family tree. 
			 This tree represents when mosques branch off from one another to create new mosques.
