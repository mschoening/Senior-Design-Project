	<p><b>About this program</b></p>
		<p>This program was created for a Senior Design Project by Team Halal Metropolis
			 the intent for users to be able to interact with the Map to show Mosques through a period of time
			 In addition there are many features to the program such as:
			 Time Slider - Allows you to pick a time frame to see what Mosques existed when and if they are closed
  	 	 Filter - Find out the main denomination of people that primarily make up the Mosque
  	 	 Search - Find a specific Mosque getting additional information about the mosque, opening date, closing date, branches
			 <!-- Initial pop up screen with a short message, can add Halal Metropolis image here -->
	</p>
</div> <!-- End div for about -->

<div id = "Time Slider"> <!-- Start div for time slider -->
	<p><b>Time Slider</b></p>
		<p>Using the Time Slider will allow you to pick a specific time frame based on year
			 To use the time slider simply scroll left from right using your finger
			 As you scroll notice the year displayed on the bottom
			 Based on the year, mosques will start appearing on the map as pillars indicating their starting date
			 As you scroll the pillars will grow in size which indicate how long they have existed
			 If a mosque changes colour, this indicates the mosque is closed
